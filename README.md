# Analyzing-Thanksgiving-Dinner

This is my second data analysis project using python. In this project I look at some Thanksgiving dinner trends thanks to data compiled by the FiveThirtyEight group. 
Unlike my first project on Gun Deaths, I make use of python libraries pandas and numpy to clean and analyze the data. My objective is to continue creating more and more robust analytics projects as I gain more proficiency in my chosen data science tools.
Comments, questions, suggestions and critiques are always welcome
