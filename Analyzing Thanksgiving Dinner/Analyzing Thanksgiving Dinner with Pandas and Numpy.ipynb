The ability to fill out a survey, particularly online necessarilly excludes a portion of the population that may not have access to computers or reliable internet connections. According to [pewresearch data](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/09/07/some-americans-dont-use-the-internet-who-are-they/), 13% of Americans don't use the internet at all, with 23% of people with incomes less than $30,000 a year having no access. The efficacy of surveys is a topic that I think warrants investigation and hopefully in the future I will have an opportunity to tackle it."
